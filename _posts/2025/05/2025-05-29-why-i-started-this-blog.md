Well, this started as a personal project to document my learning journey in software development. To get started, this comes from a mentorship program I've bought recently, called Dev Eficiente, which is focused in developing scalable applications using the best practices. If you want to know more about it, check out [this link](https://deveficiente.com/).

In the start, it is recommended to write about what we are learning, and to be honest, I've never documented anything about what I learned. So, at principle, I thought it would be a good idea to start writing about topics I am learning, and this is how this blog started.

This blog has no intention to provide, tutorials, guides or anything like that, not by now at least. I just intend to share ideas and concepts I am learning, especially those ones that I find interesting and that I think could be useful for others.

Since I'm not a professional writer and also not a native English speaker, I might make some mistakes in my writing. 

I hope this blog may be useful not only for me, but also for others who are learning and want to share their knowledge. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulocvieira/).

I hope you enjoy reading my posts and find them helpful in your own learning journey. Thank you for stopping by!
